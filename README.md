# rwm - The Rusty Window Manager

rwm is a dynamic tilling (and floating) window manager for X11 using the tag system of dwm and the server/client style of bspwm.
It's written in Rust using [bindings](https://crates.io/crates/x11rb) to the xcb library.

# DO NOT USE THIS YET
This is not a viable window manager yet, it's extremely early in its development.
